 * constructor type swap, not a rewrite, when replacing TDLib.
 *
 * Unlike TDLib's fetcher (one instance shared across potentially many files by fileId), this
 * wraps exactly one gotd/td PlaybackSession, matching this module's one-playback-session-at-a-
 * time scope (see TdlibBridgeObject) — the fileId parameters below are accepted (so call sites
 * don't need to change) but not consulted against [session].
 *
 * Every [session] call below goes through [GomobileCallGate] — confirmed live that [close] racing
 * an unrelated Sushi protocol call (itself a [app.oxplayer.tdlibbridge.session.OxTelegramClient]
 * call) crashes the whole process with `fatal error: bulkBarrierPreWrite: unaligned arguments`,
 * since both cross into the same gomobile-bound oxtelegram.aar runtime. [awaitBytesAvailable] and
 * [cancelDownload] are included too: TdlibBridgeObject's own doc notes a new session's start and
 * the previous one's teardown are explicitly not ordered, so the same overlap is possible here.
