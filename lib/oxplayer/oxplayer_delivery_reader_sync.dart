/// now picks per REQUEST from readerKindHeader (see OxplayerReaderKindInterceptor), because the
/// same account is routinely used from multiple devices in different modes at once: e.g. a phone
/// that did QR login (session) and an older TV that only ever ran /connectbot (bot). Both are
/// valid simultaneously. So this no longer compares native's mode against the account's "default"
/// — it only asks whether native's CURRENT identity (whatever it is) still exists for this
/// account:
///  - native is bot-mode: fine as long as the account still has a connected personal bot.
///  - native holds a real phone/QR session: always fine once linked — a session identity doesn't
///    stop being valid just because the account also has a bot connected elsewhere.
///  - native has no ready identity yet (fresh device): bootstrap bot-mode if the account has a
///    bot to provision (the only silent option — a real session needs interactive phone/QR/2FA).
///
/// Getting this wrong used to fail in two different directions on this exact multi-device
/// scenario: comparing against the account's default (session, since 2026-08-16's backend change)
/// flagged a device that was CORRECTLY running bot-mode as a mismatch and blocked every play on
/// it, even though the account's bot was still connected and the new per-request header would
/// have routed to it just fine.
///
/// Returns the outcome rather than throwing, and — importantly — rather than swallowing it. An
/// earlier version caught everything and logged, which let playback proceed on the wrong account
/// and present as a mysterious stall. Callers on the play path must treat
/// [OxplayerReaderSyncResult.mismatched] as fatal; best-effort callers (prefetch, login panel) can
/// ignore the result, which is why this reports instead of deciding.
