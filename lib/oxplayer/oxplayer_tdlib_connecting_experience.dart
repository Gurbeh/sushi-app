/// Full-screen "we are actually working" experience shown while the first Telegram MTProto
/// connection for this device is establishing.
///
/// Confirmed on-device (2026-08-18, verbose gotd trace): the ~15-18s this takes is not network —
/// it is CPU-bound Diffie-Hellman key generation (big-integer modular exponentiation) for a fresh
/// MTProto auth key, which is unusually slow on this class of TV hardware. A bare spinner reads as
/// frozen for that whole stretch, so this cycles a typewriter-animated set of status lines instead
/// — the same trick modern AI-agent UIs use to keep a genuinely-working wait from feeling stuck.
///
/// Deliberately no back/cancel affordance: the operation underneath is bounded by the caller's own
/// timeout (submitBotToken's ~100s ceiling — see _kAuthRpcTimeout in
/// oxplayer_tdlib_bridge_controller.dart) and always resolves to either success (the caller stops
/// rendering this) or a thrown OxplayerTdlibBridgeException the caller's own error UI handles with
/// Retry — so there is no state this screen could trap someone in longer than that ceiling.
///
/// This exact reconnect also happens right after the user taps Log out (native tears down the
/// session, then has to establish a brand new one before the login screen can even show a QR/phone
/// form) — showing the same "signing you in" narrative there read as wrong to someone who just
/// asked to sign OUT. See [OxplayerTdlibBridgeController.justLoggedOut]: this widget picks a
/// distinct logout-flavored phrase set for that one reconnect cycle.
