/// time.
///
/// This exists for two reasons at once: it's the "one message per second" outbound scheduler
/// docs/11 §4 already calls for (never built, but the constraint is real regardless), and — found
/// the hard way, live on a real phone — running two of these calls concurrently (e.g. a dashboard
/// home refresh overlapping a detail screen's item fetch) crashes the whole process with a native
/// Go runtime fault (`fatal error: bulkBarrierPreWrite: unaligned arguments`), reproduced on both
/// an x86_64 emulator and an arm64 device. gomobile's generated JNI bridge is not safe to enter from
/// two threads at once for this client, so nothing may call it without going through here.
///
/// Two lanes, not two threads: the JNI single-entry rule above is unchanged — exactly one call runs
/// at a time. [priority] only reorders what runs *next* when the current call finishes. The
/// playback path (arm waiter → /play → startPlaybackSession → deliveryRef polling) takes the fast
/// lane so a slow or dead API bot answering an unrelated /item can no longer sit in front of a
/// user's tap for its full reply timeout (device log 2026-09-01: a 25s /item timeout delayed a
/// play warmup by ~14s).
